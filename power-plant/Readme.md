# Combined Cycle Power Plant

    - Dataset: ~10.000 examples
    - Features: temperature (AT), vaccum (V), pressure (AP), humidity (RH)
    - Label: energy output (PE) 
    - Linear regression with multiple features model can be used
    - implemented batch gradient descent
    - splitted the dataset into train/test sets
    - evaluated the algorithm using R2 score
