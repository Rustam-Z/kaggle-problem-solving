# Linear Regression with Multiple Variables (Features)

By Rustam_ZðŸš€ 

Linear regression with multiple variables to
predict the prices of houses. 

Suppose you are selling your house and you want to know what a good market price would be. One way to do this is to first collect information on recent houses sold and make a model of housing
prices.

Dataset: contains a training set of housing prices in Portland, Oregon. The first column is the `size of the house` (in square feet), the second column is the `number of bedrooms`, and the third column is the `price
of the house`.
