General notes:

    - The gradient shows how much the parameter x needs to change (in positive or negative direction) to minimize C.
    
    - Back-propagation is the process of calculating the derivatives and gradient descent is the process of descending through the gradient, i.e. adjusting the parameters of the model to go down through the loss function.
